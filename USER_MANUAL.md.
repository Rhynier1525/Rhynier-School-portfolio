Prototype Description:
	The prototype was created with the use of photoshop. Adobe Photoshop is a powerful software program used for raster image editing. In simpler terms, it allows you to edit and manipulate photos and digital images.  It's a popular choice for photographers, graphic designers, and web designers. This platform is also very conducive to collaboration among teams. 
User Scenario: 
	Father Michael, the parish priest, used to dread the time-consuming ordeal of searching for baptismal and confirmation records. Dusty file cabinets held years of paperwork, often leading to misplaced documents and frustrated parishioners waiting for important records.  Then, Grace Records arrived.  

The change was immediate. With a few clicks, Father Michael could access any record digitally. No more shuffling through endless files â€“ Grace Records' intuitive search function made finding specific entries a breeze.  This newfound efficiency translated to happier parishioners.  Baptismal certificates for school enrollment or confirmation documents needed for marriage preparation were readily available, eliminating delays and anxieties.  The secure digital storage provided by Grace Records also offered peace of mind, knowing these crucial documents were safe from loss or damage. Beyond streamlined record retrieval, Grace Records offered unexpected benefits. Father Michael discovered features for generating reports on parish demographics and tracking upcoming confirmation anniversaries. This newfound data allowed him to tailor outreach programs and better serve his community.  With Grace Records, Father Michael was no longer a slave to paperwork. He was empowered to focus on his core mission:  serving his parishioners.
